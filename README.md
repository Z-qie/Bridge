Bridge - 2D Pixel Episodic Game Design (Unity)
This game is currently under developing by Unity engine with my friends, C# language, Photoshop, Asprite, and FL Studio. Inspired by one of my earlier landscape architecture design, this episodic game tells a story of how this surreal bridge kept the chronological memory of one place and how the busy-office worker (character) will change the attitude towards life after going through the bridge.
